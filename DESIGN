Application which takes in a bunch of options and it can handle those options.

Then we'll need a thread which runs the command prompt.

Then we want a thread which runs the drawing.

The client will have two particular modes of operations
either in local or server mode.

Then we'll have the server which we'll have to run.

so the client will have
the following options
--local
--server, takes an ipv4 ipaddress
--port, takes a port
--username, takes a name maybe set a maximum on the size of the username

if --local is
proivded non of the other options are avaliable
if nothing is provided it is  assumed to be running in local mode
if --server is provided an ip address is expected
if --port is not provided when --server the default port is used
if --username is not provided the simple userN where N is the next
user is used.


the commands section i.e. reading commands should be simple read
in the stream from user input. if we match a letter we should
try to consume all the next letters until we reach some of the
letters which are a whitespace and then consume accordingly.
accepth when we reach a newline which is the point at which we
flush so we have to deal with that.
